# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as a foundation for designing, developing and delivering a product that aligns with user needs and business objectives.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Cost and Time Efficiency- It helps to detect error early which minimizes rework.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: It helps to manage stakeholders expectations and project boundaries.
3. Enhances Communiation: It aligns the objectives of developers, testers and stakeholders.
4. Risk Mitigation: identifies ambiguities early, thereby reducing costly mid-projects changes.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering: gathering requirements through interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation
2. Requirement Elicitation: conducting brainstorming session to generate ideas, discussion groups to with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirement
3. Requirement Documentation: creating clear, structured artifacts like Software Requirement Specification, user storie or used cases
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling: clarifying ambiguities, reolvigs conflicts, ensuring feasibility and creating models
5. Requirement Validation: confirming the requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuraccy and completeness.

# Requirement Gathering
  - Involves identifying the stakeholders and collecting initial requirements.
  - Focuses on understanding the business needs, project scope, and key constraints.
  - May include interviews, questionnaires, or reviewing existing documentation.

# Requirement Elicitation
  - A deeper process of extracting detailed and precise requirements from stakeholders.
  - Techniques include brainstorming, workshops, use case development, and prototyping.
  - Helps bridge gaps between what stakeholders want and what they actually need.

# Requirement Documentation
  - Captures all gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format.
  - Common formats include Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams.
  - Serves as a reference for both technical and non-technical teams throughout development.

# Requirement Analysis and Modeling
  - Analyzes requirements for feasibility, clarity, completeness, and consistency.
  - Models such as data flow diagrams (DFD), entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), or UML are used to visualize requirements.
  - Helps uncover ambiguities and refine requirements for implementation.

# Requirement Validation
  - Ensures the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.
  - Activities include reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and requirement traceability.
  - Confirms that requirements are testable, achievable, and aligned with business goals.

# Acceptance Criteria
**Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis**
1. Provide a basis for testing and validation.
2. Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
3. Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
