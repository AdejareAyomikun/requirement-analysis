# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
**What is Requirement Analysis?**

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

**Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.**

**Requirement Gathering**
  - Involves identifying the stakeholders and collecting initial requirements.
  - Focuses on understanding the business needs, project scope, and key constraints.
  - May include interviews, questionnaires, or reviewing existing documentation.

**Requirement Elicitation**
  - A deeper process of extracting detailed and precise requirements from stakeholders.
  - Techniques include brainstorming, workshops, use case development, and prototyping.
  - Helps bridge gaps between what stakeholders want and what they actually need.

**Requirement Documentation**
  - Captures all gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format.
  - Common formats include Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case diagrams.
  - Serves as a reference for both technical and non-technical teams throughout development.

**Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Analyzes requirements for feasibility, clarity, completeness, and consistency.
  - Models such as data flow diagrams (DFD), entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), or UML are used to visualize requirements.
  - Helps uncover ambiguities and refine requirements for implementation.

**Requirement Validation**
  - Ensures the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.
  - Activities include reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and requirement traceability.
  - Confirms that requirements are testable, achievable, and aligned with business goals.

# Acceptance Criteria
**Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis**
1. Provide a basis for testing and validation.
2. Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
3. Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
